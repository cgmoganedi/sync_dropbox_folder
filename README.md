2. Set up a virtual environment:
    `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`

3. Install the required packages:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Dropbox access token :
    `touch .env`
    and add in it:
    DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_access_token_here>

## Usage

1. Modify the `local_file_path` and `remote_file_path` variables in `src/main.py` to specify the paths for your local and remote files in Dropbox.

2. Run the application:
    `python src/main.py`
    The application will upload the specified local file to Dropbox and then download it as "downloaded_file.txt".

## Assumptions

◉ The application currently supports uploading and downloading single files to and from Dropbox.

## Future Features

◉ Directory synchronization: Enhance the application to support synchronizing entire directories between local and remote.
◉ Batch processing: Implement the ability to upload/download multiple files in one operation.
◉ User-friendly interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a more intuitive experience for users.
◉ Error handling improvement: Implement more robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
◉ Encryption: Add an option to encrypt files before uploading them to Dropbox for enhanced security.
